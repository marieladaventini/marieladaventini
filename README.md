👋 Hi, I’m Mariela Daventini.

# 👨‍💻 From COBOL to Copilot: An IT Odyssey Since '1993!

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm a seasoned voyager in the realm of code, having set sail in the era when COBOL reigned supreme and CLIPPER was the avant-garde. My odyssey has spanned from the monolithic mainframes to the collaborative cosmos of GitHub.

## [🚀 My Journey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marieladaventini/)
My career is a rich tapestry of technologies, each thread spun from diverse experiences and self-taught mastery. I've witnessed the evolution from monochrome monitors to today's digital vibrancy, always navigating with a blend of humor and adaptability.

## 👀 Interests
I have a keen interest in **DevSecOps**, the art of integrating and delivering versions  throughout the **ALM application lifecycle management**. My expertise in this area began before it was formally recognized; as a **Configuration Manager** informed by ITIL V3, I was the linchpin, like **[Samba](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Main_Page)**, to ensure seamless interactions between Development Teams and Infrastructure Teams.

## 🌱 Learning
I'm a lifelong learner, perpetually expanding my knowledge horizon. Currently, I'm delving into the latest in tech and best practices for DevSecOps, guided by the insights from [DORA](https://dora.dev/), the DevOps Research and Assessment.

## 💞️ Collaboration
I'm on the lookout for innovative projects and like-minded individuals to collaborate with. If you're passionate about coding a future as bright as our screens, let's connect!
